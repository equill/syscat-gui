# syscat-gui

It's a basic web-GUI for [Syscat](https://github.com/equill/syscat), a knowledge-management system (yes, another one!) built on [Restagraph](https://equill.github.io/restagraph/).

If it looks like it was built by a back-end developer with a history in infrastructure and not in graphic design, UI or UX, there's a good reason for that. It's very much Works For Meâ„¢. Even worse, it was forked from webcat-gui, which was made by the same guy.
