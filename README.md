# webcat-gui

It's a basic web-GUI for [Webcat](https://github.com/equill/webcat), a knowledge-management system (yes, another one!) built on [Restagraph](https://equill.github.io/restagraph/).

If it looks like it was built by a back-end developer with a history in infrastructure and not in graphic design, UI or UX, there's a good reason for that. It's very much Works For Meâ„¢.
